# Trailer-films

If you want to see the trailer of that movie you're looking forward to, or that of your favorite movie or any other, this is your website!

## Content

In this project, with the help of react-youtube, a page was designed that allows you to view thousands of movie trailers, along with their respective technical specifications. It also allows the user to search for any title and returns a series of results that expands the range of possibilities for the user.
